# Passr

## Getting Started (Development)

### Required Software

To develop this project you must have the following installed:

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

    -   Type `git` into your terminal/cmd to see if it is already installed

-   [nodejs 12.19](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    -   You may have this installed if you have worked on other javascript projects. Type `node -v` into your terminal to see if it is installed and which version.
    -   If it isn't installed, you can follow that link or use a tool called [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for installing and managing multiple versions. Great when you work on multiple projects. If you are on Windows, checkout [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

### Steps

Once the required software is installed, do the following to run the project.

1. Clone the project into a directory that you can easily access, like a git directory in your documents. `git clone https://github.com/VikeLabs/Passr.git`

1. Run `npm install` to install all the npm packages
1. Run `npm start` to begin running the project. See [npm start](<#`npm start`>) for details.
1. Now you can make edits to the JS files and see the changes refresh in the browser before your eyes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br /> You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br /> See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br /> Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.s

### `npm run lint` or `npm run lint:fix`

Runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) on all (ts,tsx,js,jsx) files in the app, the latter command also fixes any ESLint errors automatically.

### `npm run prettier`

Runs [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to automatically format code on all (ts, tsx, jsx, jsx) files in the app.
