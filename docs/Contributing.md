## Ticketing System

We use [Jira](passr.atlassian.net) to keep track of all of our work.

### Sprints

We follow agile methodologies with 2 week sprints. Every 2 weeks we will build a sprint and try to get those tickets done within the 2 week period.

### Ticket Management

**You, and only you,** are responsible for moving your tickets through the jira swim lanes.

You can take any unassigned ticket from the `Todo` column in the sprint. If there is work in the backlog you feel should be in a sprint, reach out to the team in the channel so we can decide on the scope change.

You may leave a ticket assigned to you in the `Todo` column.

Once you begin work on the ticket, move it to the `In Progress` column. The ticket will remain here until you are ready to open a pull request (not a draft).

Once you open a PR (not a draft) move the ticket into the `In Review` column so the team has another point of visibility for what is in review.

Once the PR is reviewed and merged, you can move the ticket into the `Done` column.
