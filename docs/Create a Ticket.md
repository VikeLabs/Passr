# Creating a Ticket

For our ticketing system we use Jira. Our Jira board can be [found here](https://passr.atlassian.net/). The following document outlines how to write a ticket, and includes the necessary information for someone to complete a ticket.

## Requirements

-   Title
-   Description
-   Acceptance Criteria

### Title

The title of a ticket should be short and descriptive. For example:

> Create account page UI

Ideally, from looking at the title you have an idea of what the ticket is.

### Description

A ticket description details what the goal of the ticket is, why we are doing the work and any additional details that might be needed to complete the ticket or any useful information.

Sometimes it is useful to add a [user story]().

Example

> As a User, I want to be able to create an account so I can keep my data. <br/> <br/>
> A user needs to be able to create an account so we can associate their grade data with an account. We also would like to allow them to use the same data on multiple devices. <br/><br/>
> A great example of a sign in page can be found here: https://dribbble.com/shots/7861676-Sign-in-Sign-up-UI

### Acceptance Criteria

The acceptance criteria is a list of things that tell you if a ticket is complete. If you can go over each item in the list and say "yes that is done", then the ticket is complete.

Example

> -   [ ] There are appropriate fields for inputting new user information <br>
> -   [ ] There is a sign up button
> -   [ ] Our logo is present

## Other Considerations

In general, there are other practices we want to follow when completing a ticket that apply to every ticket. See [Completing a Ticket](<./Completed Ticket.md>).
